The application is focused mainly on the idea of simplifying a hectic work in real life by making it a systematic process done via an application. 
Navigation for tourists was made simpler with this application having voice guide option with GPS navigation,
providing filter based and intelligent search system with live information on the places visited by the tourists.



Problem Statement
The Tourism Service deals with the problems of tourists like scheduling the visit and
planning of the trip to manage their holidays. Gathering of the information and planning of
the entire schedule when the tourists visit places is a challenging task. The Tourism Service
addresses these problems and provides a smarter and simpler solution.
